# Common conversion methods between number bases include:

### Binary to Decimal

Sum the products of each binary digit and its corresponding power of 2.

- Example: `1010` in binary is `1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 10` in decimal.

### Decimal to Binary

Divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainders.

- Example: `10` in decimal is `1010` in binary.

### Hexadecimal to Decimal

Sum the products of each hexadecimal digit and its corresponding power of 16.

- Example: `1F` in hexadecimal is `1*16^1 + F*16^0 = 1*16 + 15 = 31` in decimal.

### Decimal to Hexadecimal

Divide the decimal number by 16 and record the remainders.

- Example: `31` in decimal is `1F` in hexadecimal.

### Binary to Hexadecimal

Group the binary digits into sets of four (starting from the right) and convert each group to its hexadecimal equivalent.

- Example: `10101100` in binary is `AC` in hexadecimal.

### Hexadecimal to Binary

Convert each hexadecimal digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent.

- Example: `AC` in hexadecimal is `10101100` in binary.

### Octal to Decimal

Sum the products of each octal digit and its corresponding power of 8.

- Example: `157` in octal is `1*8^2 + 5*8^1 + 7*8^0 = 111` in decimal.

### Decimal to Octal

Divide the decimal number by 8 and record the remainders.

- Example: `111` in decimal is `157` in octal.

### Binary to Octal

Group the binary digits into sets of three (starting from the right) and convert each group to its octal equivalent.

- Example: `10101100` in binary is `254` in octal.

### Octal to Binary

Convert each octal digit to its 3-bit binary equivalent.

- Example: `254` in octal is `10101100` in binary.
