# Dynamic Data Structures

Dynamic data structures are flexible structures that can change in size during a program's execution. Unlike static data structures, which have a fixed size, dynamic data structures adjust their size based on the program's needs, allowing for efficient memory usage.

## Key Features of Dynamic Data Structures

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:

   - Memory is allocated and freed during runtime.
   - This ensures that only the required amount of memory is used, optimizing memory efficiency.

2. **Flexibility**:

   - These structures can grow or shrink as needed, making them ideal for applications where the size of the data set is unpredictable.

3. **Efficient Insertions and Deletions**:
   - Insertions and deletions are faster compared to static structures like arrays, as thereâ€™s no need to shift elements around.

## Common Types of Dynamic Data Structures

### Linked List

- **Description**: A sequence of nodes, each containing data and a reference (link) to the next node.
- **Advantages**:
  - Efficient for adding or removing elements.
  - Can grow or shrink as needed.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Uses extra memory for storing links.
  - Access time is linear (O(n)).

### Stack

- **Description**: A collection of elements organized in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) order. Elements are added and removed from the top.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to implement.
  - Ideal for scenarios where the most recently added element needs to be processed first.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Only the top element can be accessed.

### Queue

- **Description**: A collection of elements organized in a First In, First Out (FIFO) order. Elements are added at the end and removed from the front.
- **Advantages**:
  - Perfect for scenarios where the order of processing matters.
  - Efficient for managing tasks sequentially.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Only the front and rear elements can be accessed.

### Tree

- **Description**: A hierarchical structure made up of nodes, where each node has a value and references to child nodes.
- **Advantages**:
  - Great for representing hierarchical data.
  - Supports fast search, insertion, and deletion.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can become unbalanced, causing slower operations.

### Graph

- **Description**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, used to represent relationships and connections between entities.
- **Advantages**:
  - Excellent for modeling complex relationships.
  - Supports various traversal algorithms.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Complex to implement and manage.

## Conclusion

Dynamic data structures offer flexibility and efficiency, making them ideal for scenarios where data size is unpredictable or frequently changes. Their ability to allocate and deallocate memory as needed, along with efficient insertions and deletions, makes them crucial for many real-time applications.
