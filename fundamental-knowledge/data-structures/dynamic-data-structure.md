# Dynamic Data Structures

Dynamic data structures are data structures that can grow and shrink in size during the execution of a program. Unlike static data structures, which have a fixed size, dynamic data structures provide flexibility and efficient memory usage by allocating and deallocating memory as needed.

## Characteristics of Dynamic Data Structures

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:

   - Memory is allocated and deallocated at runtime.
   - Allows for efficient use of memory, as only the required amount of memory is used.

2. **Flexibility**:

   - Can grow and shrink in size based on the operations performed.
   - Suitable for applications where the size of the data set is not known in advance.

3. **Efficient Insertions and Deletions**:
   - Insertions and deletions can be performed without the need to shift elements, as is required in static data structures like arrays.

## Common Types of Dynamic Data Structures

### Linked List

- **Description**: A sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
- **Advantages**:
  - Efficient insertions and deletions.
  - Can easily grow and shrink in size.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires extra memory for storing references.
  - Access time is linear (O(n)).

### Stack

- **Description**: A collection of elements with Last In, First Out (LIFO) access. Elements are added and removed from the top.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple implementation.
  - Efficient for scenarios where the most recently added element is processed first.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited access to elements (only the top element can be accessed).

### Queue

- **Description**: A collection of elements with First In, First Out (FIFO) access. Elements are added at the end and removed from the front.
- **Advantages**:
  - Suitable for scenarios where order of processing is important.
  - Efficient for managing tasks in a sequential manner.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited access to elements (only the front and rear elements can be accessed).

### Tree

- **Description**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and references to child nodes.
- **Advantages**:
  - Efficient for hierarchical data representation.
  - Supports fast search, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can become unbalanced, leading to inefficient operations.

### Graph

- **Description**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. Used to represent relationships and connections between entities.
- **Advantages**:
  - Suitable for representing complex relationships.
  - Supports various traversal algorithms.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can be complex to implement and manage.

## Conclusion

Dynamic data structures provide the flexibility and efficiency needed for many applications. By allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions, they are well-suited for scenarios where the size of the data set is not known in advance or changes frequently.
