# Summary of Rust Documentation

## Overview

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It enables developers to write safe, concurrent, and high-performance applications without sacrificing control over system resources.

---

## Key Features

- **Memory Safety**: Guarantees memory safety without a garbage collector.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in features for safe concurrent programming.
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level abstractions with no performance penalties.
- **Ownership System**: Prevents memory issues like null pointer dereferencing and data races.
- **Pattern Matching**: Powerful pattern matching capabilities for handling complex data structures.
- **Tooling**: Excellent support for building, testing, and managing projects with `cargo`.

---

## Core Concepts

### Syntax Basics

- **Hello World**:

  ```rust
  fn main() {
      println!("Hello, Rust!");
  }
  ```

- **Comments**:
  ```rust
  // Single-line comment
  /* Multi-line comment */
  ```

### Variables and Constants

- **Variables**:
  Variables are immutable by default, use `mut` for mutability:

  ```rust
  let x = 5; // Immutable
  let mut y = 10; // Mutable
  ```

- **Constants**:
  Constants are always immutable:
  ```rust
  const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
  ```

---

## Data Types

- **Primitive Types**:
  - `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`
- **Compound Types**:
  - `tuple`, `array`

### Tuples

- Fixed-size, ordered collection of elements:
  ```rust
  let person: (&str, u32) = ("Alice", 30);
  ```

### Arrays

- Fixed-size collection of elements of the same type:
  ```rust
  let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  ```

---

## Control Structures

### Conditionals

```rust
if x > 0 {
    println!("Positive");
} else if x == 0 {
    println!("Zero");
} else {
    println!("Negative");
}
```

### Loops

- **For Loop**:

  ```rust
  for i in 0..5 {
      println!("{}", i);
  }
  ```

- **While Loop**:

  ```rust
  while x < 5 {
      x += 1;
  }
  ```

- **Loop (Infinite Loop)**:
  ```rust
  loop {
      println!("This will loop forever!");
  }
  ```

---

## Functions

- **Function Declaration**:

  ```rust
  fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
      a + b
  }
  ```

- **Return Values**:
  Rust functions return values implicitly if the last expression is a return value:

  ```rust
  fn multiply(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
      a * b // implicit return
  }
  ```

- **Anonymous Functions (Closures)**:
  ```rust
  let square = |x: i32| x * x;
  println!("{}", square(5));
  ```

---

## Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes

### Ownership

- Every value in Rust has a variable that is its **owner**.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.

### Borrowing

- You can **borrow** references to data, allowing access without ownership transfer:
  ```rust
  let s = String::from("Hello");
  let r = &s; // Borrowing s
  ```

### Lifetimes

- Lifetimes ensure that references are valid as long as the data they point to is valid, preventing dangling references.

---

## Structs and Enums

### Structs

- Custom data types that allow you to store related data:
  ```rust
  struct Person {
      name: String,
      age: u32,
  }
  let person = Person { name: String::from("Alice"), age: 30 };
  ```

### Enums

- Define types that can be one of several possible variants:
  ```rust
  enum Direction {
      Up,
      Down,
      Left,
      Right,
  }
  let move_dir = Direction::Up;
  ```

---

## Pattern Matching

- **Pattern Matching with `match`**:
  ```rust
  let x = 5;
  match x {
      1 => println!("One"),
      2 => println!("Two"),
      5 => println!("Five"),
      _ => println!("Other"),
  }
  ```

---

## Error Handling

- Rust uses **Result** and **Option** types for error handling.

### `Result` Type

- Represents either success (`Ok`) or failure (`Err`):
  ```rust
  fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> Result<i32, String> {
      if b == 0 {
          Err(String::from("Cannot divide by zero"))
      } else {
          Ok(a / b)
      }
  }
  ```

### `Option` Type

- Represents an optional value, used when a value might be `None`:
  ```rust
  let some_value: Option<i32> = Some(10);
  let no_value: Option<i32> = None;
  ```

---

## Concurrency

- **Threads**: Create new threads using the `std::thread` module.

  ```rust
  use std::thread;

  thread::spawn(|| {
      println!("Hello from another thread!");
  }).join().unwrap();
  ```

- **Channels**: Communicate between threads via channels.
  ```rust
  use std::sync::mpsc;
  let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
  tx.send("Message").unwrap();
  println!("{}", rx.recv().unwrap());
  ```

---

## File Handling

- **Reading from a File**:

  ```rust
  use std::fs::File;
  use std::io::Read;

  let mut file = File::open("example.txt").expect("File not found");
  let mut contents = String::new();
  file.read_to_string(&mut contents).expect("Error reading file");
  ```

- **Writing to a File**:

  ```rust
  use std::fs::File;
  use std::io::Write;

  let mut file = File::create("example.txt").expect("Could not create file");
  file.write_all(b"Hello, Rust!").expect("Error writing to file");
  ```

---

## Cargo and Crates

- **Cargo**: Rust's package manager and build system.
- Create a new project:
  ```bash
  cargo new my_project
  ```
- Build and run the project:

  ```bash
  cargo build
  cargo run
  ```

- **Crates.io**: Rust’s official package registry, where you can find libraries (called crates) for various tasks.

---

## Best Practices

- Use ownership and borrowing principles to manage memory safely.
- Write idiomatic Rust code by following conventions for naming, error handling, and structure.
- Use `cargo fmt` for consistent formatting and `cargo clippy` for linting.
- Avoid using `unsafe` unless absolutely necessary.
