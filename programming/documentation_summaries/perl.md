# Summary of Perl Documentation

## Overview

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, and interpreted programming language known for its powerful text-processing capabilities. It is widely used for system administration, web development, and network programming.

---

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: No need to declare variable types explicitly.
- **Rich Text Processing**: Built-in support for regular expressions.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on various operating systems.
- **CPAN**: Comprehensive Perl Archive Network offers thousands of reusable modules.
- **Scripting and Automation**: Ideal for automating tasks and quick prototyping.

---

## Core Concepts

### Variables

- **Scalar**: Stores a single value (string, number, or reference).
  ```perl
  my $name = "Perl";
  ```
- **Array**: Ordered list of values.
  ```perl
  my @colors = ("red", "green", "blue");
  ```
- **Hash**: Key-value pairs.
  ```perl
  my %ages = ("Alice" => 30, "Bob" => 25);
  ```

### Contexts

- Perl evaluates expressions in **scalar** or **list** context:
  ```perl
  my $count = @colors; # Scalar context: Number of elements
  my @list = @colors;  # List context: All elements
  ```

---

## Operators

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
- String: `.` (concatenation), `x` (repetition)
- Comparison:
  - Numbers: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
  - Strings: `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `gt`, `le`, `ge`
- Regular Expressions:
  - Match: `=~ /pattern/`
  - Negated Match: `!~ /pattern/`

---

## Control Flow

### Conditionals

```perl
if ($age > 18) {
    print "Adult\n";
} elsif ($age > 12) {
    print "Teenager\n";
} else {
    print "Child\n";
}
```

### Loops

- **For Loop**:
  ```perl
  for my $color (@colors) {
      print "$color\n";
  }
  ```
- **While Loop**:
  ```perl
  while ($age < 30) {
      $age++;
  }
  ```

---

## Subroutines

- Define reusable code blocks:
  ```perl
  sub greet {
      my $name = shift;
      return "Hello, $name!";
  }
  print greet("Alice");
  ```

---

## Regular Expressions

- Perl excels at text manipulation:
  ```perl
  my $string = "Hello World";
  if ($string =~ /World/) {
      print "Match found!\n";
  }
  $string =~ s/World/Perl/; # Substitution
  ```

---

## File Handling

- **Reading a File**:
  ```perl
  open(my $fh, "<", "file.txt") or die "Cannot open file: $!";
  while (my $line = <$fh>) {
      print $line;
  }
  close($fh);
  ```
- **Writing to a File**:
  ```perl
  open(my $fh, ">", "file.txt") or die "Cannot write to file: $!";
  print $fh "Hello, Perl!\n";
  close($fh);
  ```

---

## Modules and Packages

- Import modules using `use`:
  ```perl
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use Math::Complex;
  ```
- Create reusable modules:
  ```perl
  package MyModule;
  sub hello {
      return "Hello, Perl!";
  }
  1;
  ```

---

## Debugging

- Run scripts with debugging enabled:
  ```bash
  perl -d script.pl
  ```
- Use `warn` and `die` for error messages:
  ```perl
  warn "This is a warning\n";
  die "This is a fatal error\n";
  ```

---

## Best Practices

- Use `use strict;` and `use warnings;` to catch errors.
- Use meaningful variable names and proper indentation.
- Leverage CPAN modules for reusable functionality.
